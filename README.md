# Fighting-Game-Project
A 2d fighting game project that was built by me in Python
Expanded upon the code of CodeJedi: https://pastebin.com/XzvCGqsz
Built over the course of less than 5 weeks as a final project for a class.

How to play:
The players control the characters fighting
using A/D or J/L to move left or right
To attack, the players will use Q/E or U/O to attack
To Jump left or right, use W/S or I/K
The game is won when one of the two is out of HP,
and the remaining player will have a prompt showing they won

At the moment, there are 3 charaters that can be played as: Hulk, Batman and Majin Buu
Player 1 can switch between Batman and Majin by pressing 1 or 2 in the mainmenu

Both of player 1 has a ranged option of attack by pressing E
Player 2 has a low frame high damage close-ranged attack by pressing O
