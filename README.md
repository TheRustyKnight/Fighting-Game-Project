# Fighting-Game-Project
A 2d fighting game project that was built by me in Python
Expanded upon the code of CodeJedi: https://pastebin.com/XzvCGqsz
Built over the course of less than 5 weeks as a final project for a class.

How to play:
The players control the characters fighting
using A/D or J/L to move left or right
To attack, the players will use Q/E or U/O to attack
To Jump left or right, use W/S or I/K
The game is won when one of the two is out of HP,
and the remaining player will have a prompt showing they won

At the moment, there are 3 charaters that can be played as: Hulk, Batman and Majin Buu
Player 1 can switch between Batman and Majin by pressing 1 or 2 in the mainmenu

Both of player 1 has a ranged option of attack by pressing E
Player 2 has a low frame high damage close-ranged attack by pressing O

To add a new charater to the project: here is what you must do
1. Prepare a sprites in gif form for the walking, attack1, attack2, defeat, taking damage, idle and jumping
2. Make a tupple for each animation filled with the correct sprites
3. Create a Player() object and fill in the correct parameters (Should be one commented right about it in code, if not use the one found at the init of player)
4. Add some way to access the charatar (replace one of the players or add another method like how player 1 can change it) 
5. Run game

I give full premission to use this code for any personal projects,
so long as a link to the original and credit is given in the doing so
